This notebook gives a brief idea to access a CSV file using pandas. 
It talks about 
* reading a CSV file ```pd.read_csv()```
* Inserting ```df.insert()```, rearranging, extracting specific columns ```df[[' ', ' ']]```
* sorting the values ```df.sort_values()```
* Merging two different csv files ```pd.merge()```
* dropping the rows that has NAN ```df.dropna()```
* locating a specific value ```df.loc[]```
* deleting particular rows ```df.drop()```
* Performing mathematical calculations in a dataframe
* Extracting the rows that has NAN in it ```.isna()```
* Saving a DataFrame to a CSV file ```df.to_csv()```

# About the sample target files
--------------------------------------

There are two sample target files attached: ```target_file_1.csv``` and ```target_file_2.csv```; output file is saved as ```saved_target_file.csv```

These target files shows the physical parameters of various exoplanets which is taken from [NASA Exoplanet Archive](exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/)
